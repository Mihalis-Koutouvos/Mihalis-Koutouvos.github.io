            Outside of coding and classwork, I love spending time on various activities:

            <ul>
                <li>Working Out:</li>
                <p>Albeit I worked out intermittently during the first couple of years of high school, I began serious weight training in my junior year of high school.
                    I lifted with two of my close friends (Daniel Zayac and Sricharan Vijayakumar) as a way to simply "get bigger." However, the stress of my senior-year 
                    classes and other personal items gave way to a new meaning for my workouts: I trained to become the best version of myself. As a result of this, I 
                    managed to lose twenty-seven pounds of fat and convert a great chunk of it into muscle (this is a core element of body recomposition) over the course 
                    of several summer months, permitting myself to feel the greatest I have felt in many years. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite this, my journey is not over, as I now hope to take this determination and perserverance from lifting into other aspects of my life such as running,
                    school work, full-time job, raising a family, and much more.
                    <br>                    
                    <br>
                    My favorite workouts include calf, bicep, or back training. 
                    <br>                    
                    <br>
                    P.S.: Arnold Schwarzenegger and Carl Weathers (Rest in Peace), you two have been great idols for me, and I seek to formulate the greatest image 
                    I want for my body because of you two. Thank you for possessing such powerful and consequential words and relaying them to motivated people like 
                    me around the world.
                </p>
                <br>
                <hr>

                <li>Running:</li>
                <p>
                    Running grew to be a substitute for swimming, which I had done for over twelve years. I did not feel like swimming was toning my body much by my senior year
                    of high school, so I switched to running full-time to experience a change in activities. I also did cross country and running club throughout elementary and 
                    high school but only truly committed to it my senior year of high school. Running is a huge reason why I have lost so many pounds on my path through body 
                    recomposition, and it serves as means of catharsis for me. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Some of my upcoming goals are to run the Boston Half and the regular Boston Marathon. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    P.S.: David Goggins, you are one of the baddest and strong-willed guys to ever walk on Earth. Your words, as critical as they are, speak volumes, and I 
                    take lots of what you say into consideration whenever making a decision or pushing myself past my limits. 
                 </p>
                <br>
                <hr>

                <li>Reading:</li>
                <p>I have been a reader for as long as I can remember. I am fond of fantasy, science-fiction, history, and psychological thrillers.
                    Some of my favorite books ever are Life of Pi (Yann Martel), Jurassic Park and The Lost World (Michael Crichton), The End of the 
                    World Is Just the Beginning (Peter Zeihan), and 1984 (George Orwell).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also love reading manga, which may or may not be considered to be books by some. My recommendations to anyone interested in reading 
                    such stories are Attack on Titan (Hajime Isayama), Monster, Pluto, 20th Century Boys and 21st Century Boys (Naoki Urasawa), Jujutsu
                    Kaisen (Gege Akutami), Erased (Kei Sanbe), and last but not least, Vinland Saga (Makoto Yukimura).
                </p>

                <li>Trying Out New Food:</li>
                <p>
                    Oh, my love for food is endless, despite growing up very picky (I am talking eating only burgers and fries at most events). As part of me maturing into 
                    the greatest version of myself, I am now on a quest to try out various foods around the world with an open mind. I have also taken the initiative to 
                    cook and bake. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Although cooking and baking has stressful moments, the outcomes are the best: I have made sweet and flaky baklava, smooth and watery pasta carbonara, and 
                    buttery and zesty shrimp scampi, just to name a few items. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am now on a path to master the craft of Mediterranean foods from countries including Greece, Italy, and Turkey, from where I share many roots from among
                    my family. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <hr>

                <li>Spending Time with Friends and Family:</li>
                <p>
                    I would not be where I am in my life without the support from and respect of my friends and family. I live for these people and look toward them for 
                    motivation when I am at my lowest, and each and every one of them has had some kind of significant impact in my life.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    P.S.: To Mom, Alexis (my brother), Babushka, Gerald, and Russell, thank you for being the loveiest people to be around. 
                    <br>
