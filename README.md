# **Personal Website for Mihalis Koutouvos**

# **Introduction:**
Here is my personal website, which dives into who I am, projects I am working on, how to contact me, and more! 
I made this to also showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are key components in Front-End
Development.



## **Website's Room for Improvement:**
I would like to add more animations to the website. I feel as if a lot of the pages feel dull, so a few bright and unique 
animations would help spark up more intrigue among my website.



## **Programming Tools and Other Technical Features:**
To build this project, I utilized the VSCode IDE. From here, I proceeded to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get the major parts of coding done. 
To monitor the project as I built it, I used the "Open With Live Server" tool.
